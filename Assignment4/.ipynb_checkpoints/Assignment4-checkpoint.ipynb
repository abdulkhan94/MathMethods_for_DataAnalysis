Initialize a list of cards, each card with a suit and a value. Generate a random number 0 through 51 to pick a card from the list. Check for Events A, B, and C. Repeat this a million times and count how many times Event A, B, or C occurred. After a million card picks, print your count divided by a million. How well does this simulation probability match the probability you calculated in Problem 9? Also print the simulation probabilities after 100; 1,000; 10,000; and 100,000 card picks. Determine how many simulated card picks are needed for the simulation probability to match your calculated probability to 3 decimal places."
